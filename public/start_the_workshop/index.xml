      <description>In this module we are going to create an Amazon Connect Instance that we will use through out the remainder of the workshop. Open the AWS management console, select the appropriate region, and navigate to the Amazon Connect console. If this is the first time launching a Connect Instance you will see a Get Started page. Click on the button Get Started.
When selecting a region review the Amazon Connect Pricing Page to determine which region will have telephone numbers available for the countries you are supporting with your Contact Center.</description>
