# Getting started

AWS Control Tower is a managed service, that provides the easiest way to set up and govern a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment based on best practices established through AWSâ€™ experience working with thousands of enterprises as they move to the cloud. You could initiate the AWS Control tower deployment from the AWS Management Console with few clicks and a form to fill.

It takes 60-90 minutes to launch an AWS Control Tower on a new AWS account. Hence we recommend to deploy the AWS Control Tower Section upfront before attending the class if possible.
