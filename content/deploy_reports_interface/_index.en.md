# Deploy the reporting interface

Amazon Connect allows you to use specific APIs to understand what is the status of your queues and also have the ability to stream agent events so you get notified and take actions when there are status changes. In this part of the workshop, we are going to deploy a Web Interface that makes use of these Amazon Connect capabilities to provide you a reporting tool so you can see what is happening to your queues and agents without having to log in in your Amazon Connect instance.
